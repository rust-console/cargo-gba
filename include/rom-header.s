/*

Immediately before you include this header in your program, you must write a
branch to the start of your actual game:

`b <label>`

Otherwise it won't work. That's just the format, the branch is part of the
header data.

A lot of the blank bytes can be edited later with the `gbafix` utility or
similar if you really care.
